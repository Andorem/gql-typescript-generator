If you ever feel like you are done with our tooling - just remove the generated/graphql from your .gitignore. That's it. You can remove the chimp dependency your project and things will continue work. Of course it might be beneficial to refactor the code a bit (like, move things from the generated folder, since they will no longer be generated.. :) ) - but that's all up to you know. 

In case you do decide to stop using the generator please reach out to use (either through an issue or emailing [Lukasz](email:lukasz@xolv.io) or [Sam](email:sam@xolv.io)) and explain your use-case/what was missing/what was problematic. We would appreciate that!
