In this section we will turn a basic Apollo-based backend into one that uses our generator.

You can watch me here (TODO), follow through the steps yourself, or if you prefer take a look at the diff here https://github.com/xolvio/graphqlator-tiny-example/pull/1/files (TODO)

For an example with a lot more use-cases like Filtering, Pagination, using actual external DataSources and Federation take a look at [Examples/Federation.md]
